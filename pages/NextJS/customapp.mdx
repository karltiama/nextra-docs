# Custom App

App component is used to initialize pages. Some features you can add:
- Persist layouts between page changes
- Keep State when navigating pages
- Inject additional data into pages
- Add global CSS

Overriding the defualt App
```js
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

```

The `Component` prop is the active page

`pageProps` is an object with the initial props that were preloaded for your page by one of the data fetching methods, otherise it is an empty object

### Caveats
- Adding a custom `App` requires a restart on the development server
- Doesnt support Next.js Data fetching methods
