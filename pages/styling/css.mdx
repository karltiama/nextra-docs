# CSS

I may have overlooked how complex CSS really was at the time.
I typically brushed over the CSS, because I was in such a rush to learn React at the time. 

## Language Fundamentals

No need to worry about learning values and properties by heart. Lots of resources out there to look up such as mdn docs.

## Basics: Flexbox vs Grid

[Grid Reference - CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

### How to utilize both

Grid is a newer than Flexbox and has less browser support, but it not a complete replacement to Flexbox, and should be used in junction with Flexbox.

- Grid can make whole page layouts
- Make literal grids
- Require less media query intervention

Flexbox is for laying out items in a single dimension in a row OR column. Grid is for layout of items in two dimensions row AND column
