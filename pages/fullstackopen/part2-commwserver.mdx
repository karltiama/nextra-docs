# Communicating With Server

## Rendering a collection, modules

I've done this multiple times, but say we have a array or an object. And we want to display it or something. The course talks over
how to parse thru that using map and how the key attribute should not be array indexes, because it will cuase errors in the long run.

https://robinpokorny.medium.com/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318

Starting with the following App.js file:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>{notes[0].content}</li>
        <li>{notes[1].content}</li>
        <li>{notes[2].content}</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The index.js file is as follows:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'

const notes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    content: 'HTML is easy',
    important: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    content: 'Browser can execute only JavaScript',
    important: false
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    content: 'GET and POST are the most important methods of HTTP protocol',
    important: true
  }
]

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <App notes={notes} />
)
```

Every note contains a boolean value marking weather the note has been categorized as important or not,
and also a unique id.

Currently a single note is rendered by accessing the objects in the array and indexing a hard-coded
number. This isnt practical and can be improved by using the map function

```js
notes.map(note => <li>{note.content}</li>)
```

Which can be then placed inside a ul tag

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => <li>{note.content}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

At this point try running the code and you get an error.


### Key attribute

Each note created must also contain a unique key value. Adding the key below:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <li key={note.id}>
            {note.content}
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In your own words, try to explain what is going on.

Here is our App.js file in which we are taking in some props from the object notes.
Returning div incapsulating a h1, and an unordered list.
The unordered list is taking each exisitng notes, maping over each individual one.
And returning a li element with the note.id and note.content for each one.



### Map

This Generates an error as well in the console, do to the next topic.

### Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys

```js
<ul>
  {notes.map((note, i) => 
    <li key={i}>
      {note.content}
    </li>
  )}
</ul>
```
Generating a value of an index where the note resides is not good practice and can create undesired problems.


Interesting side note that I read in the article linked, stated that the correct practice is to reach for a existing
stable ID inside your list item. So it does have errors durring the render period in react.

### Refactoring Modules

```js
const Note = ({ note }) => {
  return (
    <li>{note.content}</li>
  )
}

const App = ({ notes }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <Note key={note.id} note={note} />
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here we are using destructuring again and we are and now we have a seperate display of a single note in its own component.
A whole React application can be written in a single file. Although it is not very practical.

Common practice is to declare each component in its own file as an ES6-modules.

In smaller applications, components are used placed in a director called components, which is turn placed within the src 

Then we proceed towards creating the Note component in its own component.

Exisiting Code on can be found on Github.

We will create a directory called components for our application and place a file named Note.js inside, its contents is as follows

```js
const Note = ({ note }) => {
  return (
    <li>{note.content}</li>
  )
}

export default Note
```

The last line of the module exports the declared module, the variable Note.

Now the file that is using the component - App.js - can import the module:

```js
import Note from './components/Note'

const App = ({ notes }) => {
  // ...
}
```

The component exported by the module is now available for use in the variable Note, just as it was earlier.

When importing our own components, their location must be given in relation to the importing file

### Exercise 2.1 - 2.5

Finishing the code from exercises 1.1 - 1.5

The component structure of the application should be like such

```
App
  Course
    Header
    Content
      Part
      Part
```

Starting of with the App.js:

```js
import Course from "./components/Course";

const App = () => {
  const courses = [
    {
      name: "Half Stack application development",
      id: 1,
      parts: [
        {
          name: "Fundamentals of React",
          exercises: 10,
          id: 1,
        },
        {
          name: "Using props to pass data",
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2,
        },
        {
          name: "State of a component",
          exercises: 14,
          id: 3,
        },
        {
          name: "Redux",
          exercises: 11,
          id: 4,
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: "Node.js",
      id: 2,
      parts: [
        {
          name: "Routing",
          exercises: 3,
          id: 1,
        },
        {
          name: "Middlewares",
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2,
        },
      ],
    },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Web development curriculum</h1>
      {courses.map((course) => (
        <Course key={course.id} course={course} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Right now this courses array is acting like a json request that we will fetch from a server.

And the return statment returns an h1 and a Course component for every course that exists.
This allows the program to always work no matter how many courses we add or remove.

Each Course is passed in with a key, which is a course id and course

Now created in a separate component folder we have a Course.js:

```js
const Course = ({ course }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <Header name={course.name} />
        <Content parts={course.parts} />
        <Total parts={course.parts} />
      </div>
    );
  };
  
  const Header = ({ name }) => {
    return <h2>{name}</h2>;
  };
  
  const Content = ({ parts }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        {parts.map((part) => (
          <Part key={part.id} name={part.name} exercises={part.exercises} />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  };
  
  const Part = ({ name, exercises }) => {
    return (
      <p>
        {name} {exercises}
      </p>
    );
  };
  
  const Total = ({ parts }) => {
    const total = parts.reduce((sum, part) => {
      return sum + part.exercises;
    }, 0);
  
    return <strong>total of {total} exercises</strong>;
  };
  
  export default Course;
```

Remember Each course has a total of 3 sections, Header, Content and Total

Starting with the Course component itself, we take in a course object as props
and we return a div containing a Header, Content and Total components.

Content takes in the course.parts object and maps thru each part of an individual course, and creates a Parts component.
Which contains a key, a name and the number of exercises.

The part component just takes in the name and number of exercises as props and returns the name and number of exercises wrapped in a p tag

Next the Total component takes in parts as a prop, and then calculates the total number of exercises for each course using the
array function reduce.

## Forms

Expanding the application in the previous sections
Then we add an HTML form to the component that will be used to add new notes.
The prevent default function, is there to prevent a reload.

[HTMLFormElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event)

How do we access the data contained in the forms input element? Thats where controlled components come in.

### Controlled components

[React docs- Controlling input with a state variable](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)

Creating a peice of state called newNote, creates errors for us and the function doesn't work as expected. And we get an
error saying we provided a value prop to a form field without an onChange handler. Thus causing the value to be only a read-only field

Since we assigned a piece of the App commponents state as the value attribute of the input element, the App component
now controls the behavior of the input element.

To enable editing of the input element, we have to register an event handler that sychronizes the changes made to the input
within the components state. This can be done with a handleNoteChange function

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState(props.notes)
  const [newNote, setNewNote] = useState(
    'a new note...'
  ) 

  // ...

  const handleNoteChange = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value)
    setNewNote(event.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <Note key={note.id} note={note} />
        )}
      </ul>
      <form onSubmit={addNote}>
        <input
          value={newNote}
          onChange={handleNoteChange}
        />
        <button type="submit">save</button>
      </form>   
    </div>
  )
}
```

If we run the program we see that the input we are typing is getting put out due to the console log we have. And we we
check the React Dev tools we also see we have a new state and it tracking every letter we input.

Now the App components newNote state reflects the current value of the input, we can complete the addNote function for created enw notes

```js
const addNote = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const noteObject = {
    content: newNote,
    important: Math.random() < 0.5,
    id: notes.length + 1,
  }

  setNotes(notes.concat(noteObject))
  setNewNote('')
}
```

First, we create a new object for the note called noteObject that will recieve its content from the components newNote state.
The unique identifier id is generated based on the total number of notes. This works because our notes are never deleted.

The new note is added to the list of notes using the [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) array method.

This method does not mutate the original notes array, but rather creates a new copy of the array with the new item
added to the end. This is very important since we must never mutate state directly in React!

### Filtering Displayed Elements

Adding new functionality to our application that allows us to only view the important notes. Lets add a piece of state to the
App compponent that keeps track of which notes should be displayed

Then lets change the component so that it stores a list of all the notes to be displayed in the notesToShow variable. The items on the list depend on the state of the component itself
