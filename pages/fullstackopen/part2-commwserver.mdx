# Communicating With Server

## Rendering a collection, modules

I've done this multiple times, but say we have a array or an object. And we want to display it or something. The course talks over
how to parse thru that using map and how the key attribute should not be array indexes, because it will cuase errors in the long run.

https://robinpokorny.medium.com/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318

Starting with the following App.js file:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>{notes[0].content}</li>
        <li>{notes[1].content}</li>
        <li>{notes[2].content}</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The index.js file is as follows:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'

const notes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    content: 'HTML is easy',
    important: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    content: 'Browser can execute only JavaScript',
    important: false
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    content: 'GET and POST are the most important methods of HTTP protocol',
    important: true
  }
]

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <App notes={notes} />
)
```

Every note contains a boolean value marking weather the note has been categorized as important or not,
and also a unique id.

Currently a single note is rendered by accessing the objects in the array and indexing a hard-coded
number. This isnt practical and can be improved by using the map function

```js
notes.map(note => <li>{note.content}</li>)
```

Which can be then placed inside a ul tag

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => <li>{note.content}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

At this point try running the code and you get an error.


### Key attribute

Each note created must also contain a unique key value. Adding the key below:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <li key={note.id}>
            {note.content}
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In your own words, try to explain what is going on.

Here is our App.js file in which we are taking in some props from the object notes.
Returning div incapsulating a h1, and an unordered list.
The unordered list is taking each exisitng notes, maping over each individual one.
And returning a li element with the note.id and note.content for each one.



### Map

This Generates an error as well in the console, do to the next topic.

### Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys

```js
<ul>
  {notes.map((note, i) => 
    <li key={i}>
      {note.content}
    </li>
  )}
</ul>
```
Generating a value of an index where the note resides is not good practice and can create undesired problems.


Interesting side note that I read in the article linked, stated that the correct practice is to reach for a existing
stable ID inside your list item. So it does have errors durring the render period in react.
[Medium](https://robinpokorny.medium.com/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318)

### Refactoring Modules

```js
const Note = ({ note }) => {
  return (
    <li>{note.content}</li>
  )
}

const App = ({ notes }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <Note key={note.id} note={note} />
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here we are using destructuring again and we are and now we have a seperate display of a single note in its own component.
A whole React application can be written in a single file. Although it is not very practical.

Common practice is to declare each component in its own file as an ES6-modules.

In smaller applications, components are used placed in a director called components, which is turn placed within the src 

Then we proceed towards creating the Note component in its own component.

Exisiting Code on can be found on Github.

We will create a directory called components for our application and place a file named Note.js inside, its contents is as follows

```js
const Note = ({ note }) => {
  return (
    <li>{note.content}</li>
  )
}

export default Note
```

The last line of the module exports the declared module, the variable Note.

Now the file that is using the component - App.js - can import the module:

```js
import Note from './components/Note'

const App = ({ notes }) => {
  // ...
}
```

The component exported by the module is now available for use in the variable Note, just as it was earlier.

When importing our own components, their location must be given in relation to the importing file

### Exercise 2.1 - 2.5

Finishing the code from exercises 1.1 - 1.5

The component structure of the application should be like such

```
App
  Course
    Header
    Content
      Part
      Part
```

Starting of with the App.js:

```js
import Course from "./components/Course";

const App = () => {
  const courses = [
    {
      name: "Half Stack application development",
      id: 1,
      parts: [
        {
          name: "Fundamentals of React",
          exercises: 10,
          id: 1,
        },
        {
          name: "Using props to pass data",
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2,
        },
        {
          name: "State of a component",
          exercises: 14,
          id: 3,
        },
        {
          name: "Redux",
          exercises: 11,
          id: 4,
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: "Node.js",
      id: 2,
      parts: [
        {
          name: "Routing",
          exercises: 3,
          id: 1,
        },
        {
          name: "Middlewares",
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2,
        },
      ],
    },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Web development curriculum</h1>
      {courses.map((course) => (
        <Course key={course.id} course={course} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Right now this courses array is acting like a json request that we will fetch from a server.

And the return statment returns an h1 and a Course component for every course that exists.
This allows the program to always work no matter how many courses we add or remove.

Each Course is passed in with a key, which is a course id and course

Now created in a separate component folder we have a Course.js:

```js
const Course = ({ course }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <Header name={course.name} />
        <Content parts={course.parts} />
        <Total parts={course.parts} />
      </div>
    );
  };
  
  const Header = ({ name }) => {
    return <h2>{name}</h2>;
  };
  
  const Content = ({ parts }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        {parts.map((part) => (
          <Part key={part.id} name={part.name} exercises={part.exercises} />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  };
  
  const Part = ({ name, exercises }) => {
    return (
      <p>
        {name} {exercises}
      </p>
    );
  };
  
  const Total = ({ parts }) => {
    const total = parts.reduce((sum, part) => {
      return sum + part.exercises;
    }, 0);
  
    return <strong>total of {total} exercises</strong>;
  };
  
  export default Course;
```

Remember Each course has a total of 3 sections, Header, Content and Total

Starting with the Course component itself, we take in a course object as props
and we return a div containing a Header, Content and Total components.

Content takes in the course.parts object and maps thru each part of an individual course, and creates a Parts component.
Which contains a key, a name and the number of exercises.

The part component just takes in the name and number of exercises as props and returns the name and number of exercises wrapped in a p tag

Next the Total component takes in parts as a prop, and then calculates the total number of exercises for each course using the
array function reduce.

## Forms

Expanding the application in the previous sections
Then we add an HTML form to the component that will be used to add new notes.
The prevent default function, is there to prevent a reload.

[HTMLFormElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event)

How do we access the data contained in the forms input element? Thats where controlled components come in.

### Controlled components

[React docs- Controlling input with a state variable](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)

Creating a peice of state called newNote, creates errors for us and the function doesn't work as expected. And we get an
error saying we provided a value prop to a form field without an onChange handler. Thus causing the value to be only a read-only field

Since we assigned a piece of the App commponents state as the value attribute of the input element, the App component
now controls the behavior of the input element.

To enable editing of the input element, we have to register an event handler that sychronizes the changes made to the input
within the components state. This can be done with a handleNoteChange function

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState(props.notes)
  const [newNote, setNewNote] = useState(
    'a new note...'
  ) 

  // ...

  const handleNoteChange = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value)
    setNewNote(event.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <Note key={note.id} note={note} />
        )}
      </ul>
      <form onSubmit={addNote}>
        <input
          value={newNote}
          onChange={handleNoteChange}
        />
        <button type="submit">save</button>
      </form>   
    </div>
  )
}
```

If we run the program we see that the input we are typing is getting put out due to the console log we have. And we we
check the React Dev tools we also see we have a new state and it tracking every letter we input.

Now the App components newNote state reflects the current value of the input, we can complete the addNote function for created enw notes

```js
const addNote = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const noteObject = {
    content: newNote,
    important: Math.random() < 0.5,
    id: notes.length + 1,
  }

  setNotes(notes.concat(noteObject))
  setNewNote('')
}
```

First, we create a new object for the note called noteObject that will recieve its content from the components newNote state.
The unique identifier id is generated based on the total number of notes. This works because our notes are never deleted.

The new note is added to the list of notes using the [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) array method.

This method does not mutate the original notes array, but rather creates a new copy of the array with the new item
added to the end. This is very important since we must never mutate state directly in React!

### Filtering Displayed Elements

Adding new functionality to our application that allows us to only view the important notes. Lets add a piece of state to the
App compponent that keeps track of which notes should be displayed

Then lets change the component so that it stores a list of all the notes to be displayed in the notesToShow variable. The items on the list depend on the state of the component itself

```js
...
  const notesToShow = showAll
    ? notes
    : notes.filter(note => note.important === true)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notesToShow.map(note =>
          <Note key={note.id} note={note} />
        )}
      </ul>
      // ...
    </div>
  )
```

Explaining the notesToshow variable:

```js
  const notesToShow = showAll
    ? notes
    : notes.filter(note => note.important === true)

```

This is rather compact and essentially what we are doing here is creating a variable notesToShow to filter weather or
not to display only notes that are tagged important or not.

The definition used the conditional operator, the basic syntax of the operator functions as follows:

```js
const result = condition ? val1 : val2
```

the result variable will be set to the value of val1 if condition is true. If the condition is false, the result
variable will be set to the value of val2.

If the value showAll is false, the notesToShow variable will be assigned to a list that only contains the important
property set to true. The filtering is done with the help of the array filter method:

```js
notes.filter(note => note.important === true)
```

Next the functionality

-- To be finished... forms section --

### Exercise 2.6 - 2.10

Note: the way to start server is "npm start"

2.6 Was completed by simple debugging and comparing example to my problem

2.7 Problem - prevent the user from being able to add names that already exist in the phonebook.

- Figure out where the comparison of the two object needs to take place

Ended up creating a variable that uses the .some() method
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some

2.8 Problem - Expand your application by allowing users to add phone numbers to the phone book. You will need to add a second input element to the form (along with its own event handler):

2.9 Problem - Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name:
- Creating a search query, requires state, event handler, and a function to filter the array

```js
  const filteredPersons = persons.filter((person) =>
    person.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
  );
```

2.10 Problem - If you have implemented your application in a single component, refactor it by extracting suitable parts into new components. Maintain the application's state and all event handlers in the App root component.

```js
const App = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Phonebook</h2>

      <Filter ... />

      <h3>Add a new</h3>

      <PersonForm 
        ...
      />

      <h3>Numbers</h3>

      <Persons ... />
    </div>
  )
}
```

So we need 3 seperate components: 'Filter', 'PersonForm' and 'PersonList'.

## Getting data from server

This section will be client-side (broswer) functionality. We will go in to a direction in which we familiarize ourselves
with how the code executing in the broswer communicates with the backend.

In this section we will be using a JSON server to act as our server.

https://github.com/typicode/json-server

Above is the github about JSON Server.
"Get a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds"

Instructions to install JSON server locally

Going forward the main principle is that we will save notes to the server, or technically saving them to the json-server.
React code fetches notes from server and renders them to screen. When a new note is added, it persist in "memory"

json-server stores all the data in the db.json file, which resides on server. In the real world it would be store in some
database.

We will get more familiar with the princiles of implimenting server-side functionality in more detail in part 3

### The broswer as a runtime enviorment

Goes over using the outdated way of fetching data that was used in part 0 using XMLHttRequest.

## npm

In this course we will be using the axios library for communication between the browser and server.

Most JS projects are defined using the node package manager, aka npm. Dependencies are just the external libraries the
project has.

Axios can be installed via the command line

```
npm install axios
```

We get an error when trying to start the server. It happens due to the fact that
the server cannot bind to port 3001 because it is already occupied by a previously started json-server.

```
npm install axios
npm install json-server --save-dev
```

There is a difference in the parameters. Axios is installed as a runtime dependency of the aplication, because the execution of the program
requires the existence of the library.

On the other hand, json-server was installed as a development dependency using save dev, since the program itself does not require it. It is used
for assistance durring software development.

Command to start server now

```js
npm run server
```

## Axios and promises

Going forward json-server is assumed to be running in port 3001

Adding the following code in index.js:

```
import axios from 'axios'

const promise = axios.get('http://localhost:3001/notes')
console.log(promise)

const promise2 = axios.get('http://localhost:3001/foobar')
console.log(promise2)
```

From my understanding we are importing a library axios, and creating 2 promises.

The result should be printed in the console.

Axios method get returns a promise.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises

A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of a asynchronous operation.
A promise can have 3 distinct states.

1. The promise is pending: Means the final value (one of the folowing two) is not available yet

2. The promise is fulfilled: Means that the operation has been completed and the final value is available
which generally is a successful operation. This state is also called resolved

3. The promise is rejected: Means that an error prevented the final value from being determined
which generally represents a failed operation

```js
axios
  .get('http://localhost:3001/notes')
  .then(response => {
    const notes = response.data
    console.log(notes)
  })
```



To access the result of the operation represented by the promise, we must register an event handler to the promise.
Do this using a then method. The then method
