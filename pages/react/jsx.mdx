# JSX

## What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JS that lets you write 
HTML-like mark-up in a JS file

## JSX: Markup into JavaScript
As the web became more interactive, logic increasingly 
detremined content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML.

Keeping a button's rendering logic and markup together ensures
that they are staying in sync with each other and conversely details
that are unrelated are not affected and isolated from each other.
Thus making it safer to change either of them on their own.
