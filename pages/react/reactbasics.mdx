# Virtual DOM
## Problem

The problem with DOM Manimulation is that it is slow compared to other 
JavaScript operations. Most JS frameworks update the DOM alot more
they have to.

Modern websites can use huge amounts of DOM manipulation and inefficent 
updating becomes a problem.

To combat this problem React implements something called the virtual DOM.

## The Virtual DOM
In React, every DOM object has a corresponding virtual DOM, essentially a
lightweight copy.

Same properties as a real DOM but lacks the ability to directly change what's
on the screen

Think of manipulation the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint as opposed to
moving rooms in an actual house.

## How it helps

Rendering a JSX element causes an update to every single virtual DOM object.
