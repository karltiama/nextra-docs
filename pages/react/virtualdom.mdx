# Virtual DOM
## Problem

The problem with DOM Manimulation is that it is slow compared to other 
JavaScript operations. Most JS frameworks update the DOM alot more
they have to.

Modern websites can use huge amounts of DOM manipulation and inefficent 
updating becomes a problem.

To combat this problem React implements something called the virtual DOM.

## The Virtual DOM
In React, every DOM object has a corresponding virtual DOM, essentially a
lightweight copy.

Same properties as a real DOM but lacks the ability to directly change what's
on the screen

Think of manipulation the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint as opposed to
moving rooms in an actual house.

## How it helps

Rendering a JSX element causes an update to every single virtual DOM object.
At only the cost of the virtual DOM, which can update quickly. Once the virtual
DOM has been updated, React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot.
Which takes the moment right before the update.

React figures out which  virtual DOM objects have change and updates those objects,
and only those objects on the real DOM.

This allows the advantage of only update the neccessary parts of the DOM

## In Summary

1. The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
2. The virtual DOM then gets compared to what it was before it was updated. React figures which objects changed
3. The changed objects, are changed and only the changed objects change and get updated on the real DOM. 
4. Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
