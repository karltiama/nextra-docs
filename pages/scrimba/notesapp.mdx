### Warm up - Scrimba - Dark / Light Mode

```

Challenge: Add a dark/light mode to the React Facts site
Imagine you've been handed this code base which includes
all the design elements for a light and dark mode already,
but the team needs you to add the functionality to it so
it can switch from light to dark mode when the toggle is
flipped.

Advice:
1. Spend a good amount of time looking through the existing
code base to make sure you understand how everything is
working
    a. Check the markup starting in index.js -> App.js
    -> Main.js and Navbar.js
    b. Follow the CSS classNames to the style.css file
    and make sure you understand how the styles should
    be applied
    c. Look closely at the conditional classNames in
    the JSX to help you decide what kind of props
    the components need to receive

2. Think carefully about which components need state.
This will help you decide where to write the code
initializing state and how to pass that state to
the components that need access to it.
    a. Also think about how state will need to change,
    and see if you can find the hint in the code as
    to how/where that should happen.

        }
        </main>
    )
}

```

### Deeper Dive

```js
    const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState([])
    const [currentNoteId, setCurrentNoteId] = React.useState(
        (notes[0] && notes[0].id) || ""
    )
```

Setting an empty array for the notes state
setting the first array and the first arrays id or sets it to empty as the initial state for currentNoteId

```js
function createNewNote() {
        const newNote = {
            id: nanoid(),
            body: "# Type your markdown note's title here"
        }
        setNotes(prevNotes => [newNote, ...prevNotes])
        setCurrentNoteId(newNote.id)
    }
```

this function createNewNote creates a newNote object with properties id and body
id is created by nanoid() and i believe nanoid just is safe way to create url-friendly ids 
and then we call setNotes and pass in a call back function of the previous note and passes in the array newNote, and the rest of the prevNotes
then we set the current note id to the new note id

```js
    function updateNote(text) {
        setNotes(oldNotes => oldNotes.map(oldNote => {
            return oldNote.id === currentNoteId
                ? { ...oldNote, body: text }
                : oldNote
        }))
    }
```

this function updates the note and passes in a variable of the text
set notes is called and a call back function is called passing the old notes thru and another chain of call functions to map and find the note that has the same id as the current note id
and if that is true then you pass thru all the old notes and also and the body of the text that we pass.

### ChatGPT Response
Your explanation of the updateNote function is quite good and captures the essence of what the function does. However, if you want to make it even clearer or more precise, you can consider the following improvements:

1. Clarify purpose. Start by stating the main purpose of the function.
The updateNote function is reponsible for updating the content of the currently selected note

2. Use more concise language.
Instead of passes in a variable of the text, say accepts a 'text' parameter which represents the updated note content

3. Highlight the conditional logic. Emphasize the importance of the conditional logic by explicitly saying that it checks wheather the 'id' of each note matches the currentNoteId to determine what note to update

Here's a revised explanation incorporating these suggestions:

"The updateNote function serves the purpose of modifying the content of the currently selected note. It takes a text parameter, which represents the updated content for the note. Inside the function, it utilizes the setNotes method with a callback function that operates on the previous state of the notes array (oldNotes).

Within this callback function, a map operation is performed on the oldNotes array. For each oldNote, the function checks whether its id matches the currentNoteId, which identifies the currently selected note for editing. If there's a match, a new object is created by copying the oldNote, but with the body property updated to the new text. This ensures that only the content of the currently selected note is modified, while all other notes remain unchanged.

```js
    function findCurrentNote() {
        return notes.find(note => {
            return note.id === currentNoteId
        }) || notes[0]
    }
```

The findCurrentNote functions serves the purpose of finding the current note to allow the side bar for additional styling.
We return the current note of the first note by taking all the notes and using the find function that matches the note id to the currentNoteId or the first note

```js
    return (
        <main>
        {
            notes.length > 0 
            ?
            <Split 
                sizes={[30, 70]} 
                direction="horizontal" 
                className="split"
            >
                <Sidebar
                    notes={notes}
                    currentNote={findCurrentNote()}
                    setCurrentNoteId={setCurrentNoteId}
                    newNote={createNewNote}
                />
                {
                    currentNoteId && 
                    notes.length > 0 &&
                    <Editor 
                        currentNote={findCurrentNote()} 
                        updateNote={updateNote} 
                    />
                }
            </Split>
            :
            <div className="no-notes">
                <h1>You have no notes</h1>
                <button 
                    className="first-note" 
                    onClick={createNewNote}
                >
                    Create one now
                </button>
            </div>
            
        }
        </main>
    )

```

This is our main page in which if there no notes, it prompts with a header and a button to create one. If there are notes we use a split component and pass in 3 props, sizes to split the page based on im assuming %, direction, and a className of split
Inside of that component we encapsulate it with a sidebar component with the props notes, currentNote and setCurrentNoteId and newNote.
Then a ternary the check if the current note id exist and the notes.length is greater than zero. If that all checks out it displays the Editor on the other 70% with props current note and update note

Going thru each component

Editor.js

```js
import React from "react"
import ReactMde from "react-mde"
import Showdown from "showdown"

export default function Editor({ currentNote, updateNote }) {
    const [selectedTab, setSelectedTab] = React.useState("write")

    const converter = new Showdown.Converter({
        tables: true,
        simplifiedAutoLink: true,
        strikethrough: true,
        tasklists: true,
    })  

    return (
        <section className="pane editor">
            <ReactMde
                value={currentNote.body}
                onChange={updateNote}
                selectedTab={selectedTab}
                onTabChange={setSelectedTab}
                generateMarkdownPreview={(markdown) =>
                    Promise.resolve(converter.makeHtml(markdown))
                }
                minEditorHeight={80}
                heightUnits="vh"
            />
        </section>
    )
}

```

This editor component receives the props curentNote and updatenote.
we set state selected tab to have a initial state of "write"
create a converter object which looks like what properties we want our editor to have.

then we reurn a section which looks like a container with classname "pane editor"
and inside that we hvae a ReactMde component which passes a bunch of props, the value, onchange prop, and others

Sidebar.js

```js
import React from "react"

export default function Sidebar(props) {
    const noteElements = props.notes.map((note, index) => (
        <div key={note.id}>
            <div
                
                className={`title ${
                    note.id === props.currentNote.id ? "selected-note" : ""
                }`}
                onClick={() => props.setCurrentNoteId(note.id)}
            >
                <h4 className="text-snippet">Note {index + 1}</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
    ))
    
    /*
    
        Implements dynamic styling with the side bar, when a individual note is selected,
    
    */
    

    return (
        <section className="pane sidebar">
            <div className="sidebar--header">
                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <button className="new-note" onClick={props.newNote}>+</button>
            </div>
            {noteElements}
        </section>
    )
}

```

This is the sidebar component, first we set notesElement equal to a list or array of notes that exist using map. Each note element is maped over using the map function and the index of that note.
Inside a div container, we have another div to keep track of the current note. Which has a dynamic class "selected-note" that is applied if the note.id matches the current note.id that was passed, and then an h4 of which note it is.


## Notes App: Features to Add

- Sync notes with localStorage
- Add note summary titles
- Move modified notes to the top of the list
- Delete notes

## Notes App: Sync notes with localStorage

- Using Local Storage

[mdn web docs - local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

- Main functions we will be using

```js
localStorage.getItem("key")
localStorage.setItem("key", value)

/*

Note: Value must be a string, so if you have a more complex
value like an array or object to save, you'll need to use:

*/

JSON.stringify(value)
JSON.parse(stringifiedValue)

```
## Local Storage - ChatGPT

- Background on localStorage

Certainly! localStorage is a web storage feature provided by web browsers that allows you to store key-value pairs of data persistently on a user's computer. Here's a brief explanation of localStorage:

Persistent Storage: localStorage provides a way to store data on a user's device that persists across browser sessions and even when the browser is closed and reopened. This means the data remains available until explicitly removed by the user or your application.

Key-Value Pairs: Data in localStorage is stored as key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for the stored data, and the value is the data you want to store. Both keys and values are typically strings.

Storage Limit: localStorage has a storage limit of around 5-10 megabytes per domain, depending on the browser. This limit is typically much larger than the size of cookies, making it suitable for storing more substantial amounts of data.

Data Type Limitation: While localStorage stores data as strings, you can store other data types (e.g., numbers, booleans) by converting them to strings before storage and parsing them when retrieved.

Same-Origin Policy: localStorage follows the same-origin policy, meaning that data stored in localStorage is only accessible by web pages from the same origin (i.e., the same protocol, domain, and port). This provides a level of security and isolation.

Simple API: localStorage provides a simple API for setting, getting, and removing data. Common methods include setItem(key, value), getItem(key), and removeItem(key).

No Expiration: Data stored in localStorage does not have an expiration date. It remains in storage until explicitly removed.

Use Cases: localStorage is often used for storing user preferences, session data, tokens for authentication, and caching data to improve application performance.

Caution: While localStorage is useful for certain scenarios, it's important to be cautious about what data you store, especially sensitive or personally identifiable information. Always consider security best practices and user privacy.

localStorage is a valuable tool for web developers when they need to store and manage data on the client-side, particularly when that data should persist between visits to a website or across browser sessions.


### Challenge

Every time the `notes` array changes, save it 
in localStorage. You'll need to use JSON.stringify()
to turn the array into a string to save in localStorage.

```js
    useEffect(() => {
        localStorage.setItem("notes", JSON.stringify(notes));
    }, [notes]);
```


When the app first loads, initialize the notes state
with the notes saved in localStorage. You'll need to
use JSON.parse() to turn the stringified array back
into a real JS array.

```js
    const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState(
        JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || [])
        
```

## Lazy State Initialization

What is Lazy State Initialization?

A technique used to ensure that a component's state initialization is only preformed once
even if the component re-renders. 

1. Normal State Initialization

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue)
```

In this case, initialValue is evaluated during each render, which can be inefficient if the value of initialValue is expensive
to compute or if you want to ensure it only runs once.

2. Lazy State Initialization with a Callback 

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {
  // Calculate the initial state value here
  return initialValue;
});
```

By wrapping the state initialization in a function, React ensures that the function is called only during the initial render, preventing it from being invoked during subsequent renders.

This lazy state initialization technique is especially useful when the initial state value depends on some complex or asynchronous computation, or when you want to avoid unnecessary computations during re-renders.

Here's a summary of the benefits:

- Improved performance: Prevents unnecessary recalculations of the initial state value.
- Ensures consistent behavior: Guarantees that the state initialization code runs only once, even if the component re-renders.
- Supports complex initialization logic: Allows you to perform complex or asynchronous operations when setting up the initial state.
- In general, it's a good practice to use the lazy state initialization approach when working with useState to ensure efficient and predictable behavior in your React components.

### Challenge

Lazily initialize our notes state so it doesnt reach into localStorage on every single re-render of the App component

```js
    const [notes, setNotes] = React.useState(
        () => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("notes")) || []
    )
```

## Notes App: Note Summary title

### Challenge

Try to figure out a way to display only the first line of note.body as the note summary in the side bar.

Hint 1: note.body has "invisible" newline characters in the text every tiem there's a new line shown.
Ex: the text in Note 1 is: "# Note summary\n\nBeginning of the note"

Hint 2: see if you can split the string into an array using the "\n" newline character as the divider


```js
<h4 className="text-snippet">{note.body.split('\n')[0]}</h4>
```

note.body: This represents the text content of the body property of a note object. This text may contain one or more lines separated by newline characters (\n).

.split('\n'): This is a JavaScript string method called split. It is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is the newline character (\n). So, the split method breaks the text into an array of strings, where each element of the array is a line from the original text.

[0]: After splitting the text, [0] is used to access the first element of the resulting array. In JavaScript, array indices start at 0, so [0] refers to the first item in the array.

So, when you put it all together, note.body.split('\n')[0] takes the note.body text, splits it into an array of lines, and then extracts the first line from that array. This is how you get the first line of text from the note.body property.
